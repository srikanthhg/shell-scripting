#In this script:

#tr -s '[:space:]' '\n' < "$file": This command translates spaces and other whitespace characters into newlines. It effectively splits the text into separate words.

#sort: This sorts the words alphabetically.

#uniq -c: This counts the occurrences of each unique word.

#wc -l: This counts the number of lines, which corresponds to the number of unique words.

#Finally, echo prints out the result.

#This script will count each unique word only once, even if it appears multiple times in the file.
